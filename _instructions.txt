IMPORTANT: WHATEVER GAME YOU DECIDE TO CREATE, YOU MUST EXTEND THE BASE-CODE PROVIDE TO YOU IN THIS PROJECT.
FAILING TO EXTEND THIS BASECODE WILL RESULT IN A NON-NEGOTIABLE ZERO FOR YOUR FINAL PROJECT. NO EXCEPTIONS.

Create a classic video game using the tools you've learned throughout the quarter. 

You have two options:

Option 1: Use the game engine to create a game other than Asteroids such as Galaga, Space Invaders, Missile Command,
Qix, etc. You MUST extend the code base provided, but you would effectively ignore/delete the Asteroids model and create
your own model.

Option 2: Use the base code provided and extend the Asteroids model to create your own version of Asteroids. If you
choose this option, you should expect to make your own special weapons, provide explosions with debris. Other options
include a shield, hyperspace, firing UFOs, guided missiles, etc. You MUST extend the code base provided.

Jonathan will select the top six games. The six finalists will demonstrate their games and present their code and
architecture, and the class will vote (noise-meter) on the best game. The winner will receive a token prize during an
awards-ceremony/reception on the last day.

**************************************************
**************************************************

Many features of the game have already been implemented.  So, what else do we need to do?? Potentially a lot.

At the very minimum, you need to:
Implement debris.
Implement scoring.
When the falcon collides with a NewShipFloater, you should increment the number of falcons. 

What else? It's your game, so use your imagination, but consider the following:

Special weapons:
You have an example of a special weapon (cruise missile). Consider creating other special weapons. You might consider
spawning an explosion (friend) when your special weapon either hits a foe, or expires.

Consider steerable missiles which activate steering while a particular key is in key-press state, and explodes (as well
as returns steering control back to the falcon) upon key-release.

Hyperspace: 
As a defensive measure, you can implement a hyperspace to randomly move the falcon to another location on the screen. 


Foes:
Various UFOs.
TitaniumAsteroid which appears at higher levels, has a special color, requires several hits before it explodes, changes
color as it weakens, and spawns smaller versions of itself like Asteroid.

Consider heat-seeking missiles that are fired from a Foe; in that case you would override the move method of
HeatSeekingMissile and adjust its orientation depending on the location of the target (the Falcon reference).

Counter-measures:
Consider defensive countermeasures like chaffing to throw your foe's heat-seeking weapons off their intended target
(the Falcon). A chaff is a heat flare that acts as a decoy to a heat-seeking missile.

Power-ups:
You have an example of a power-up called NewShipFloater. Create other power-ups for special weapons and other goodies.
These goodies should have time limits which would then be refelcted in a meter displayed in the margin.

Shield:
Create a shield for the falcon. Perhaps the shield changes color as it weakens, and perhaps you need to get a power-up
to use the sheild for a limited period of time.


Meters:
Create color-coded meters that show graphically how much time is left on a power-up, goodie, shield, or other vital
information.


Falcon morphs:
Consider morphing the falcon into various color/shape combinations as it receives power-ups (see Cruise to see how
morphing is done). You are not limited to two morphs, create several if you want.


Debris:
The Sprite class has a method called public Point[] getObjectPoints(). You can use this to get the points which describe
the Sprite an any given frame. It may be easier for you to create your own Debris class from scratch that implements
Movable, rather than extending Sprite, but either way will work.

 
Special Levels:
You may consider creating a labyrinth out of which the falcon must successfully navigate within a given time, without
touching the walls, and acquiring goodies along the way.

Other:
I've just scratched the surface as far as possible mods to the game; use your imagination to come up with more features. 

Some things to keep in mind. 

1/ Sprite is essentially a shape circumscribed by a circle, which makes collision detection really easy. The down-side
is that polar coordinates are difficult to work with. However, I created a method that allows you to create shapes using
an ArrayList<Point> where the points are on a cartesian grid with 0,0 at the origin. When you add your points to the
ArrayList, order matters, so that each point is adjascent to its neighbor in the ArrayList. The following ArrayList<Point>
describes the shape of the cruise-missile prior to deploying its wings and accelerating. Just keep in mind that creating
this ArrayList<Point> out-of-order will produce a jaggedy-shaped sprite. The following order is correct (though I could
have traversed the points counter-clockwise with the same good result).


		ArrayList<Point> pntAs = new ArrayList<Point>();
		pntAs.add(new Point(0, 5)); //top point
		pntAs.add(new Point(1, 3));  //right top point
		pntAs.add(new Point(1, -2)); //right bottom point
		pntAs.add(new Point(-1, -2)); // left bottom point
		pntAs.add(new Point(-1, 3)); //left top point
		assignPolorPointsAlts(pntAs);



Some addition info:
the M key is for muting music. 
the f-key is for firing the cruise missile.
