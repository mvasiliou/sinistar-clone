Welcome to Sinistar!

You control a small space ship, stuck in the detritus of an exploded planet while being chased by SINISTAR.
You're only hope is to hold off SINISTAR as long as possible by launching SiniBombs, which are created from Crystals.

Each Crystal you mine from an Asteroid will be converted into a SiniBomb, though destroying an Asteroid does not guarantee a Crystal.
You can check your current SiniBomb total in the bottom right side of the screen. When close by, a SiniBomb will
lock on to SINISTAR and destroy a piece. If it hits any other enemy first, it will explode.

As the game goes on, Worker Ships also collect Crystals and bring them to the build site to construct SINISTAR piece
by piece. When SINISTAR reaches ten pieces, he launches into a fit of rage to attack you anywhere on the map.

Meanwhile, Turret Ships fly throughout the asteroid field, mining crystals and hunting you down. As a turret passes you
it has a small chance of locking onto your location and firing to kill. One hit from a turret will destroy your ship.

The minimap displays your current screen, plus a screen on either of side of you. The map is set up to be a rectangle 5
times the width of your screen and 5 times the height, with looping through to the other edge of the map.




Side Note: I was not entirely sure how difficult to make this game. Some friends told me it was too easy, some said too
hard, though this version is definitely easier than the original game. If you'd like the game to be easier, lower the
amount of Worker Ships and Turrets, raise the amount of Asteroids and the probability of mining a Crystal and lower
SINISTARS speed and the opposite for making the game harder.
